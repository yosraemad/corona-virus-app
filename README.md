# Corona App

> _"This too shall pass"_

This is an app made by flutter that shows the recent updates and provides you news and help so that you can pass this pandemic.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this app was to apply what I learned in the past three months on a real app. Since, we are in the middle of the pandemic, I thought that it would be a good life application to create a mobile application that updates us with the last news about Covid-19.
